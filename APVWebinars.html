<p>According to Gary Shilling, the U.S. and other major economies will plod along in 2017 with no recessions or financial crises in sight. It’s a view worth taking seriously since Gary has built his reputation over many decades by spotting big bubbles and predicting their collapses. In this webinar, Gary will offer his views on where the U.S. economy is heading this year and the potential impact of President Trump's proposals. Specific topics he will cover include:</p>

<ul class="help">
    <li>Why weak global economic growth will continue;</li>
    <li>Why U.S. consumers are saving, not spending;</li>
    <li>Why the future of crude oil prices is down;</li>
    <li>What's been driving voters' "mad as hell" sentiments;</li>
    <li>The effects of Brexit; and</li>
    <li>The threat and implications of deflation in the U.S. and Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gary will answer attendees’ questions during the webinar. If you'd like to submit questions in advance, login to APViewpoint and post them to <a href="http://www.apviewpoint.com/join-the-convesation?view=topic&sub=2&catid=93&id=18363#18363">this discussion</a>.</p>

<p>Is investment portfolio design becoming commoditized as countless articles, papers, and blogs say? If this process merely involves measuring risk tolerance and recommending a model portfolio the answer is “Yes.”</p>
<p>But there’s a better way to design investment portfolios. It starts by recognizing that risk perception isn’t static and that knowledgeable clients make better investment decisions. In this presentation, Christopher will:</p>
<ul class="help">
    <li>provide a framework for a collaborative, educational design process that gives clients greater awareness of their own risk tolerance, a truly customized portfolio, and a higher level of confidence in their decisions;</li>
    <li>explain how to incorporate client behavioral risks such as “frame of reference risk” into portfolio construction; and</li>
    <li>discuss sophisticated tools that make this process more interactive and engaging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Christopher will answer attendees’ questions during the webinar and will be available to continue the discussion on APViewpoint.</p>

<p>Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have promised to get rid of the “carried interest” taxation that benefits many wealthy individuals. This provides favorable treatment of long-term capital gains compensation for certain categories of business owners, partners and executives. Should this occur, this compensation will be taxed at normal income rates, which are double the normal long-term capital gains tax rates. Advisors whose high net worth clients are facing this risk need to create a backup plan to reduce their clients’ current tax obligations without sacrificing their quality of life.</p>
<p>In this webinar, David will review the elements of such backup plans and outline the specific steps needed to prepare for the possible elimination of the carried interest treatment. Advisors will learn:</p>
<ul class="help">
    <li>How carried interest works;</li>
    <li>How to identify clients who could be affected by its elimination;</li>
    <li>The elements of a viable backup plan; and</li>
    <li>How to discuss and mitigate the “hard” and “soft” issues that serve as motivating factors in triggering a backup plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many top minds in finance have shown that asset allocation is the primary determinant of long-term investment results. Others trumpet the virtues of passive management. Yet, many investors—and advisors—end up making unintended active bets in asset allocation—even when they think they’re investing passively.</p>
<p>In this first part of a four-part webinar series, Adam Butler outlines a logical framework for asset allocation that is consistent with the most basic principles of finance. During this session, you will learn:</p>
<ul class="help">
    <li>Why most investors’ asset allocation strategies inadvertently take an extreme active stance;</li>
    <li>Why supposedly passive domestic 60/40 portfolios carry the highest risk of expressing surprisingly active views;</li>
    <li>How one unique global asset allocation strategy allows advisors and investors to truly invest passively; and</li>
    <li>How advisors can implement this strategy for their clients using cost-effective ETFs.</li>

<p>Everyone makes active bets on asset allocation. But few do it thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Thousands of asset allocation methodologies are compatible with efficient markets. That’s why advisors need to understand the implicit “bets” they place when constructing portfolios.</p>

<ul class="help">

    <li>Different ways to optimize diversification;</li>
    <li>How to estimate risk and correlation in the portfolio-construction process; and</li>

</div>
<p>The traditional 60/40 balanced portfolio is actually "unbalanced" because it is designed to flourish in a limited spectrum of economic environments characterized by growth, benign inflation, and abundant liquidity conditions. Worse, the high level of equity volatility mostly dilutes the moderating benefits of bonds.</p>
<p>Risk parity portfolios address this imbalance. Complementing traditional U.S. equity and bond positions with alternative asset classes, and with an appropriate balance of risks, can help a portfolio thrive across a wide variety of market environments.</p>
<p>In this third part of a four-part webinar series, Adam Butler will reveal:</p>
<ul class="help">
    <li>Why constructing portfolios on the basis of long-term capital market expectations is a fool’s errand;</li>
    <li>Why a broadly diversified and properly balanced risk parity portfolio encompassing a wide range of asset classes is better positioned to balance risks and perform well under most realistic economic environments;</li>
    <li>How dynamic estimates of risks and correlations can eliminate the need for long-term forecasts; and</li>
    <li>How multi-asset factor tilts can address many of the most common concerns about risk parity portfolios.</li>

<p>According to research from Morningstar and the Investment Company Institute, many unskilled investors are abandoning active stock selection in favor of active factor, sector, and asset allocation. But these investors are making the same mistakes in a different domain. In this environment, skilled investors have a greater opportunity to profit from active asset allocation than traditional security selection.</p>
<p>This prompts these questions: What methods are most effective at sorting winners from losers across asset classes? Are the observable effects of factors such as value and momentum even stronger across asset classes than at the individual security level? If so, what is the best way to harness these multi-asset factor strategies while maximizing diversification to minimize portfolio risk?</p>
<p>In this final part of a four-part webinar series, Adam provides an overview of active multi-asset "factor" strategies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Adaptive-Asset-Allocation-Dynamic-Portfolios/dp/1119220351" target="_blank">Adaptive Asset Allocation</a>. In particular, you will learn:</p>
<ul class="help">
    <li>Why investors are abandoning active mutual funds in favor of index funds and ETFs;</li>
    <li>Why poor index timing decisions have kept unskilled ETF investors from realizing strong returns from these products;</li>

    <li>Why multi-asset ‘smart beta’ strategies are well positioned to harvest large excess returns from this pool; and</li>

<p>Many investors are asking advisors for environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing solutions that reflect their moral and political values. The problem is that most of these strategies are flawed in two important ways:</p>
<ol class="help" type="1">
    <li>Historically there have been seven distinct approaches to ESG investing, implemented in products characterized by inadequate diversification and skewed returns.</li>
    <li>ESG index providers rely on key performance indicators (KPIs)—quantitative and qualitative metrics that demonstrate a company’s business effectiveness—based on public regulatory filings that often don’t provide enough information to enable advisors to make informed ESG recommendations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our “integration approach” to ESG investing seeks to resolve these flaws. It leverages innovations in data science to enable asset managers to develop and apply systematic investment strategies that evaluate each company’s E, S and G indicators to identify KPIs that significantly impact risk/return with strong predictability. Integrating ESG-related KPIs into portfolio analysis and risk management methodologies allows advisors to recommend more diversified ESG core equity investment solutions to clients. In this webinar, advisors will learn:</p>
<ul class="help">
    <li>The seven historically distinct approaches to ESG investing;</li>
    <li>How ESG attributes impact a corporation’s reputation, value and long-term business performance;</li>
    <li>How data science is making it easier to identify KPIs that accurately measure the impact of ESG policies on investment performance;</li>
    <li>How a diversified portfolio should balance risk and return characteristics of multiple KPIs in all three sleeves of ESG; and</li>
    <li>How multi-category ESG tilts can potentially further reduce risk and amplify long-term returns.</li>

    <p>FlexShares STOXX US ESG Impact Index Fund (ESG) and the FlexShares STOXX Global ESG Impact Index Fund (ESGG) are passively managed and use a representative sampling strategy to track their underlying index respectively. Use of a representative sampling strategy creates tracking risk where the Fund’s performance could vary substantially from the performance of the underlying index. The Funds are subject to environmental, social and governance (ESG) Investment Risk, which is the risk that because the methodology of the Underlying Indices selects and assigns weights to securities of issuers for non-financial reasons, the Funds may underperform the broader equity market or other funds that do not utilize ESG criteria when selecting investments. The Funds are also at increased risk of industry concentration, where it may be more than 25% invested in the assets of a single industry. For ESGG, investments in foreign market securities involve certain risks such as currency volatility, political and social instability and reduced market liquidity. The Funds may also invest in derivative instruments. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate with the underlying asset, rate or index and the Funds could lose more than the principal amount invested.</p>

<p>The release of the so-called “Panama Papers” has raised the veil on the secretive tax evasion practices of some wealthy investors and generated substantial public outrage aimed at financial firms and high profile clients connected with these schemes.</p>

    <li>Which of these entities can be used for legitimate tax purposes;</li>

<p>The popularity of smart beta ETFs has skyrocketed, especially factor-based strategies. According to Morningstar, there is now $544 billion invested in smart beta products, a five-fold increase since 2008. But the limitations of simple factor-based strategies make them unsuitable for “buy and hold” investors, who still tend to favor actively managed mutual funds.</p>
<p>Gavekal Capital has identified a new “Super Factor” that breaks through the confines of simple factors. New research has shown that this Super Factor not only outperformed all five of the most common simple factors, but also generated alpha.</p>
<p>What is this Super Factor? Knowledge. Join us to learn how the Knowledge Factor captures the excess returns of companies that invest in innovation, offering long-term investors an alternative to factor-based ETFs and actively managed mutual funds.</p>
<p>In this webinar, participants will learn:</p>

    <li>How Gavekal Capital identifies companies that have a tendency to experience excess returns to create the Super Factor; and</li>

<p>The data is clear: Prospects make 60%-80% of their decisions in the first few minutes (or less!) after meeting you.</p>
<p>That’s how long you have to convince them you are the advisor with whom they should place their trust.</p>
<p>But even advisors who make positive first impressions can "snatch defeat from the jaws of victory" once the meeting begins. In the first part of this webinar, Dan Solin will discuss how to use the science of first impressions to immediately establish a positive image when meeting prospects for the first time. He will cover the impact of:</p>
<ul class="help">
    <li>Clothes: How to select suitable attire, based on regional differences and the demographics of the prospect;</li>
    <li>Facial expressions: How smiling, eye contact and other expressions of validation and empathy build trust;</li>
    <li>Gestures: How to maximize the effectiveness of hand and arm movements; and</li>
    <li>Touch: The “correct” method of hand-shaking and other ways to generate positive perceptions through touch.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second part, Dan will leverage the latest findings from neuroscience researchers, studies on dating and relationships, and other sources to provide strategies for building empathy and trust with prospects, asking the right questions, avoiding conversational pitfalls and closing more business.</p>
<p>On APViewpoint, members can view presenters' answers to attendees' questions that were not covered during the presentation and discuss its content with other advisors and thought leaders.</p>

<p>New rules from the Treasury increase the attractiveness of longevity annuities held within IRAs. The ability to avoid required minimum distributions on qualified assets held within a Qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract (QLAC) provides additional deferral benefit that reduces the net costs of annuitizing a portion of retirement wealth. Longevity annuities pool later-life income risk, providing a lower cost and safer way to fund later life income within a retirement income plan. This presentation includes new analyses on:</p>
<ul class="help">
    <li>How the QLAC rules allow a retiree to achieve significant pooling benefits of a longevity annuity with little tradeoff in expected legacy amount;</li>
    <li>The reduction in cost of funding later life income through a product that pools longevity risk;</li>
    <li>Improvements in shortfall risk in simulations that include a QLAC; and</li>
    <li>The behavioral benefits of providing a guaranteed source of later-life income</li>
</ul>
<p>During the session Michael and Alan will answer advisors’ questions and will be available afterward to discuss their presentation on APViewpoint.</p>

In this live webinar and Q&amp;A session, Kathleen will discuss strategies for engaging clients in wealth conversations that enable advisors to:</p>
<ul class="help">
    <li>understand typical client money mindsets and their associated financial beliefs and behaviors;</li>

<p>Wealth management is in a constant state of evolution. Yet, many advisors still hold on to outdated processes and practices that are being supplanted by a new generation of online advice technologies. To remain competitive and relevant, advisors need to rethink their core value propositions and find new ways to add value to client relationships.</p>

<ul class="help">
    <li>Why advisors need to differentiate themselves in a “race to zero” market environment that is becoming increasingly commoditized by online advice platforms;</li>
    <li>How adopting a goals-based approach to proposing, managing, and reporting on client portfolios can help advisors can align themselves more effectively with the ways clients actually think about their money; and</li>
    <li>How embracing this enhanced level of service will require advisors to rethink traditional client reporting and communications.</li>

Yet, most financial advisors utilize theories and practices that are of no help at all in improving client outcomes. As more investors become aware that passively-managed index funds generally beat the vast majority of actively-managed funds, the advisory profession has responded by emphasizing strategies, from rebalancing to “smart beta,” that claim to deliver new investment alpha. This webinar will show that none of these and other implied “alpha-generators” adds any value, and that advisors would be better off following Warren Buffett’s advice that “you should invest in stocks as you would in a farm.” Using this axiom as a launching point, Michael will:</p>

<p>There are two fundamental schools of thought concerning the planning and implementation of retiree income withdrawal strategies:</p>
<ul class="help">
    <li>The probability-based school of thought argues that systematic withdrawals from a diversified portfolio, when based on a withdrawal rate that would have worked historically, will be fundamentally sustainable over a client's lifetime.</li>
    <li>In the safety-first approach, also called lifestyle finance, spending goals are segmented between essential and discretionary needs, and clients use different investing strategies for each type of goal.</li>

<p>For nationally known industry consultant and commentator Bob Veres, robo-advisors represent the latest in a series of challenges advisors have faced in recent years. But rather than threatening the profession, Bob believes that these online advice platforms are doing advisors a favor by:</p>
<ul class="help">
    <li>Automating the most labor-intensive and commoditized aspects of their jobs</li>
    <li>Freeing up time for advisors to have more meaningful and impactful interactions with their clients</li>
    <li>Giving them the opportunity to differentiate between the cookie-cutter approach of algorithm-based advice and the highly personalized attention and service advisors provide to help their clients address their financial challenges with greater confidence</li>
</ul>
